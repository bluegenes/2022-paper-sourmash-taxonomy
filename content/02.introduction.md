Taxonomic profiling intro...

Sourmash gather is a method to use combinatorial observations of k-mers to find the minimum set of reference genomes that contain all k-mers of the query dataset. Sourmash gather results are non-overlapping: each k-mer is assigned to one and only one genome match. Gather results are to specific genomes, but many biological applications work at the species-level, rather than strain level. This is especially important as these strain matches may not be the best/ideal results. In many cases, the specific strain in your dataset may not be available in the database, meaning the results end up matching to a few suboptimal reference genomes. Sourmash taxonomy is a sourmash module designed to ingest sourmash gather results, integrate taxonomic information, and optionally aggregate the results using a lowest-common-ancestor approach.

from blog post:

As the exact strains from novel sequencing projects are often not present in reference databases, gather results commonly include matches to multiple strains of the same species, if there are multiple strains present in the reference database. These matches represent the portions of our novel query strain(s) that share genomic content with strains in the reference database.

he main innovation of the gather–>tax method is that LCA aggregation occurs at the genome level, or really at the “groups of k-mers” level, rather than at the individual k-mer level.

Single k-mers, either for true biological reasons or as a result of reference inaccuracies, can sometimes match to quite different organisms and derail the individual k-mer LCA approach (nicely laid out in this twitter thread):
In our experience, aggregating k-mer matches to the set of best genome matches with gather prior to LCA means contamination and other reference issues are far less likely to impact LCA annotations. As an added benefit, this approach allows us to do taxonomic assignment with multiple taxonomies (e.g. GTDB if available, NCBI for the remaining), so long as the gather was run against the appropriate databases.
