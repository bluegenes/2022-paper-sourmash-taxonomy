## Discussion



- Database recommendations
<!--
As with all reference-based analysis, results can be affected by the completeness of the reference database. However, summarizing taxonomic results from gather minimizes issues associated with increasing size and redundancy of reference databases.
For supported databases (e.g. GTDB, NCBI), we provide taxonomy csv files, but they can also be generated for user-generated databases.

- Limitations
  - K-mer size -- > specificity/ sensitivity
  - K21 will give you species assignments, but you might not want to use them...
- Improvements:
  - Tax db inside of zip database?
  - Additional plotting?
  - CAMI output (need taxid)
  - genbank vs gtdb taxonomy translation?
